# MultiClass-Classification-Forest-Trees
This project was made to study how Multi-class Classification Neural Networks are made using Machine Learning Modules like sklearn, tensorflow, and basic
python packages like NumPy, Pandas.

Did statistical analysis of the Tree dataset, like variation of tree type with slope and elevation, finding correlation between Tree type and other 14 
parameters. Plotting 2D and 3D graphs for analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Also studied how usage of Linear (Model1) and Softmax (Model2) Activation Function makes change in the Model.

Didn't find much difference between the Accuracy Score both models.

But there was difference in loss entropy for both models.
